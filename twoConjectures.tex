Let $(S, mm, k)$ be a regular local ring of dimension $n$, and $I\subset mm^3$ an ideal. Set R = S/I.
Let $K$ be the Koszul complex of the maximal ideal in $R$ , and let $\widetilde K$ be the 
minimal $R$-free resolution of $k$. 

Persistence conjecture (Dao, Eisenbud): if $Cycles_i(\widetilde K)$ has a socle summand, then so does 
$Cycles_{i+1}(\widetilde K)$ unless $i=n$, in which case $Cycles_{i+2}(\widetilde K)$ also has a socle summand.

Let KK be the list of complexes obtained by successively killing cycles, starting from K.

Persistence conjecture (Dao, Eisenbud): if $Cycles_i(KK_i)$ has a socle summand and $i<n$ then  
$Cycles_i(KK_i)$ has a socle summand  contained in $K_i$.
